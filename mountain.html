        <h2>About the Himalayan Mountains</h2>
        <p>
            The Himalayas, often referred to as the "abode of snow," is a vast mountain range in Asia,
            spanning across several countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and China. It is home to
            some of the world's highest peaks, including Mount Everest.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Impact of Climate on the Himalayas</h2>
        <p>
            The Himalayas are highly sensitive to climate change. Rising global temperatures have led
            to the melting of glaciers, resulting in glacial retreat and the formation of glacial lakes.
            These changes pose significant challenges to local ecosystems, water resources, and communities
            that depend on glacial meltwater.
